# Video-ke

## Overview ##

> Video-oke is a Karoake application that obtains videos from Youtube.

> Video-oke was inspiried by picking up the codebase for TRNTBL3000, an app that allowed crossfading across two playlists. Video-oke incorporates this need but adds video functionality and the ability to search the Youtube API to add the songs you want to sing or listen to and use a crossfader in between songs.

## Dependencies ##
> Youtube API v3

> Assert

> JQuery

> Bootstrap

> Express.js

> Node.js

## Roadmap ##

  -have multiple DJ-ing sound clips and special FX
  display lyrics for karaoke usage

## Notes on the Procfile ##
